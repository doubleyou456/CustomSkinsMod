# CustomSkinsMod
 A mod to load skins into UNBEATABLE[White Label]

Download and extract the zip file into your 'UNBEATABLE [white label]' folder like you did for Taco's Custom Beatmaps Mod (which needs to be installed for the skins mod to work).

Once installed, press '/' in the main menu to toggle the mod on/off (default on), and press '<' or '>' in the main menu to switch Beat or Quaver skins respectively; look at the BepInEx console for feedback (sorry to anyone who has only one monitor). Toggling the mod off and on will reload all skins.

The mod comes with Guac's Peak Divide skin for Beat and lastrowjoe's Bocchi skin for Quaver, to add more skins create a new folder in the respective 'xxxCustomSkins' folder in unbeatable -> then put the png of the new skin in that new folder. **If the skin needs to have the Sprite data changed please contact me**.

If you have any question, comments, errors, ect. please let me know, this is my first time making a mod for public use
